Introduction 👀
This is a single-player game of Rock-Paper-Scissors played against the computer, made in Python language.

How It Works 🚀
First, the player is prompted for a name, which is saved for use on the scoresheet.

The player is then asked to make a choice between rock, paper and scissors. This can either be inputted as:
R for Rock
P for Paper
S for Scissors

The Program then generates a random result (Rock, paper, or scissors) as well and that is compared with the user's input to determine the winner.

The Rules 📜
Rock vs Paper ==> Paper Wins
Paper wraps rock

Rock vs Scissors ==> Rock Wins
Rock smashes scissors

Scissors vs Paper ==> Scissors Wins
Scissors cuts paper

If a wrong input is chosen by the user, the program prompts the user to input a valid option by throwing an error message
